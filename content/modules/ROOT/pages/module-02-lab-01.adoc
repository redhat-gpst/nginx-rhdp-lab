Deploy NGINX Plus Ingress Controller with NAP to provide security for
the Arcadia application
-----------------------------------------------------------

== Deployment Overview

In Module 1, we have already deployed the NGINX Ingress Controller, so
we will focus on configuring NGINX App Protect in this module. For the
complete installation of the NGINX Plus Ingress Controller, refer to the
official documentation
https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-manifests/[Installation
with Manifests]

At a high level, we will:

____
. Configure role-based access control (RBAC)
. Create the common Kubernetes resources
. Install the Ingress Controller with NGINX App Protect WAF
. Configure the NGINX App Protect WAF module
. Attach NAP Policy to the NGINX Ingress Controller’s Virtual Server
____

Clone the Ingress Controller repository and navigate to the deployments
folder by running the following commands:

____
[source,]
----
git clone https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress.git --branch v3.0.1
cd kubernetes-ingress/deployments
----
____

== Configure role-based access control (RBAC)

In Module 1, we created a namespace and a service account for the
Ingress Controller, as well as a cluster role and a cluster role binding
for the service account. To use the App Protect WAF module, we need to
create the App Protect role and role binding by running the following
command:

____
[source,]
----
oc apply -f rbac/ap-rbac.yaml
----
____

== Create the common Kubernetes resources

In Module 1, we created:

* a secret with a TLS certificate and a key for the default server in
NGINX:
* a config map for customizing NGINX configuration
* an IngressClass resource

No additional common resource is needed for the App Protect WAF module.

== Create Custom Resources

In Module 1, we created custom resource definitions for VirtualServer
and VirtualServerRoute, TransportServer, and Policy resources. To use
the App Protect WAF module, we need to create custom resource
definitions for APPolicy, APLogConf, and APUserSig. Run the following
commands to create these resources:

____
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f common/crds/appprotect.f5.com_aplogconfs.yaml
oc apply -f common/crds/appprotect.f5.com_appolicies.yaml
oc apply -f common/crds/appprotect.f5.com_apusersigs.yaml
----
____

== Update the Ingress Controller with NGINX App Protect WAF

*Steps*

____
. Enable the App Protect module in the Ingress Controller.
+
Enable the App Protect module in the Ingress Controller by clicking on
"Operators" and then "Installed Operators" in the OpenShift Console's
left navigation column. On the page that opens, click the Nginx Ingress
Controller link in the "Provided APIs" column, select
"my-nginx-ingress-controller," and then click YAML to change the
apppotect 'enable' field to true under spec: controller:
+
____
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: charts.nginx.org/v1alpha1
kind: NginxIngress

spec:
controller:
    appprotect:
    enable: True
----

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Make sure that you have pulled the Ingress Controller image with App
Protect. In this lab, we have already loaded the NGINX Plus image with
App Protect to a local registry.
====
. After reloading, wait for the KIC pod to become available by running
the command:
+
[source,BASH]
----
oc get pod -n nginx-ingress --watch
----
. When it's ready, press `ctrl-c` to stop the watch.

== Configure the NGINX App Protect WAF module

Now, it is time to configure the Ingress Controller with CRD ressources
(WAF policy, Log profile, Ingress routing ...)

*Steps*

Execute the following commands to deploy the different resources. In the
terminal window, copy the below text and paste+enter:

____
--
[source,bash]
----
cd /home/lab-user/kubernetes-ingress/examples/custom-resources/app-protect-waf

oc apply -f syslog.yaml
oc apply -f ap-apple-uds.yaml
oc apply -f ap-dataguard-alarm-policy.yaml
oc apply -f ap-logconf.yaml
oc apply -f waf.yaml
----

Out of above commands, we focus on the following files:

[arabic]
. The `ap-dataguard-alarm-policy.yaml` file creates the WAF policy that
specifies the rules for protecting the application from layer 7 attacks.
It is recommended to customize this policy according to the specific
application requirements.

In this lab, we will proceed by disregarding the "apple_sigs" signature
set. Kindly remove the subsequent lines from
`ap-dataguard-alarm-policy.yaml`:

____
[source,yaml]
----
signature-requirements:
- tag: Fruits
signature-sets:
- name: apple_sigs
  block: true
  signatureSet:
    filter:
      tagValue: Fruits
      tagFilter: eq
----
____

If preferred, you can also accomplish this using the 'sed' command as
follows:

____
[source,bash]
----
sed -i '/signature-requirements:/,/eq/d' ap-dataguard-alarm-policy.yaml
----
____

Once modified, your `ap-dataguard-alarm-policy.yaml` should resemble
this:

____
____

In the terminal window, copy the below text and paste+enter, to reapply
the `ap-dataguard-alarm-policy.yaml`:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f ap-dataguard-alarm-policy.yaml
----

[arabic, start=2]
. The `ap-logconf.yaml` file creates the Log Profile that specifies the
format of the logs to be generated when the policy detects an attack.

____
____

{empty}3. The `waf.yaml` file creates the WAF configuration that links
the WAF policy and Log Profile to the NGINX Ingress Controller. ..
literalinclude :: ./templates/waf.yaml :language: yaml

____

== Attach NAP Policy to the NGINX Ingress Controller’s Virtual Server

It is important that the application always has a WAF protecting it.

To enable NAP for an application, a Virtual Server in NGINX Ingress
Controller requires both a Policy and an APPolicy custom resource to be
attached to it. You simply need to add the reference to the Virtual
Server.

*Steps*

. Examine the contents of the *VirtualServer* resource
`oc get virtualserver arcadia`.
+
____
[source,bash]
----
oc get virtualserver arcadia
----
____
. update VirtualServer `oc edit virtualserver arcadia`
+
____
[source,bash]
----
oc edit virtualserver arcadia
----
____
. Add the following content to the lines immediately following
[.title-ref]#host: $nginx_ingress#, at the same indentation level:
+
____
[source,yaml]
----
policies:
- name: waf-policy
----

Once modified, your `virtualserver` yaml should resemble this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.nginx.org/v1
kind: VirtualServer
metadata:
  name: arcadia
spec:
  host: $nginx_ingress
  policies:
  - name: waf-policy
  upstreams:
  - name: arcadia-main
    service: arcadia-main
    port: 80
  - name: arcadia-app2
    service: arcadia-app2
    port: 80
  - name: arcadia-app3
    service: arcadia-app3
    port: 80
----

The waf-policy should match the name of the WAF policy created in step
2.6.
____
. Save the file and exit the editor.
