== Lab Overview

This lab, *NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller For OpenShift*, demonstrates how to deploy, manage, and secure applications using NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller (KIC) in an OpenShift environment. The lab uses the Arcadia Financial application as an example app to illustrate NGINX KIC capabilities, including advanced routing, load balancing, and security with NGINX App Protect WAF.

== Lab Structure

The lab is organized into two modules, with each module building on the previous one:

* **Module 1: Deploying NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller**
  - Learn to deploy and configure the NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller within OpenShift.
  - Set up basic routing and load balancing for containerized applications using Custom Resources.
* **Module 2: Securing Applications with NGINX App Protect WAF**
  - Enable and configure NGINX App Protect WAF to provide Layer 7 protection for applications running in OpenShift.
  - Apply WAF policies and test their effectiveness against common web application attacks.
  - Simulate real-world Layer 7 attacks to evaluate the NGINX App Protect WAF.
  - Validate the security configurations and review logs for insights.

== Lab Access

The terminal window to your right is *already* logged into the lab environment as the `{ssh_user}` user via `ssh`. 
All steps in this lab should be executed as the `{ssh_user}` user.

Follow the instructions in each module to complete the lab exercises. The terminal provides all necessary tools to interact with the OpenShift environment and the NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller.

=== Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have basic knowledge of Kubernetes, containers, and NGINX. Familiarity with OpenShift and Kubernetes CLI commands is recommended.

=== Sample Command

Throughout this lab, you will execute commands like the one below to interact with OpenShift and NGINX KIC:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n {kubernetes_namespace}
----

.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-ingress-controller-6bdf59f99-2vh9q  1/1     Running   0          10m
----

== Next Steps

Proceed to Module 1 to begin deploying the NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller in OpenShift. Each module includes step-by-step instructions, explanations, and sample commands to help you understand the features of NGINX KIC and NGINX App Protect WAF.
