== NGINX Ingress Controller Deployment

=== Introduction

With the infrastructure in place to support the solution, the NGINX
Ingress Controller deployment can begin.

_What is NGINX Ingress Controller?_

NGINX Ingress Controller provides a robust feature set to secure,
strengthen, and scale containerized apps, including:

* Advanced app-centric configuration - Use role-based access control
(RBAC) and self-service to set up security guardrails (not gates), so
teams can manage their apps securely and with agility. Enable multi-
tenancy, reusability, simpler configs, and more.
* Visibility and performance monitoring - Pinpoint undesirable behaviors
and performance bottlenecks to simplify troubleshooting and make fixes
faster.

NGINX Ingress Controller has two offerings, an open-source edition and a
purchased supported solution. Both solutions come from NGINX; however,
there are features and performance differences between the two
offerings. Below are popular features and use cases.

This solution uses the purchased NGINX Ingress Controller.

Kubernetes deployments are typically maintained through manifest files.
The deployment of the NGINX Ingress Controller will be created through
manifests. Multiple Kubernetes resources can be made through a single
file. When executed, Kubernetes will build all the resources.

Kubernetes resources types created:

* Kubernetes namespace
* Kubernetes service account
* Kubernetes cluster role
* Kubernetes clusterrolebinding
* Kubernetes secret
* Kubernetes configmap
* Kubernetes ingressclass
* Kubernetes customresourcedefinitions
* NGINX Ingress Controller deployment
* NGINX Ingress Controller service


*NGINX Ingress Operator* A Kubernetes Operator is a method of packaging,
deploying, and managing a Kubernetes-native application. The NGINX
Ingress Operator for OpenShift is a supported and certified mechanism
for deploying NGINX Plus Ingress Controller for Kubernetes alongside the
default router in an OpenShift environment, with point-and-click
installation and automatic upgrades.

=== Validate the NGINX Ingress Controller

In this lab, we already installed the NGINX Ingress Operator from the
OpenShift console.

We also deployed the NGINX Plus Ingress Controller for Kubernetes
deployment.

In the terminal window copy the below text and paste into the termmial to verify
that the Operator is running


[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get csv -n nginx-ingress -o wide
----

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
NAME                            DISPLAY                  VERSION   REPLACES   PHASE
nginx-ingress-operator.v3.1.0   Nginx Ingress Operator   3.1.0                Succeeded
----

From the OpenShift Console, Click Operators -> Installed Operator in the
left navigation column. On the page that opens, click the Nginx Ingress
Controller link in the Provided APIs column. NginxIngressController is a
custom resource which the Operator uses to deploy the NGINX Plus Ingress
Controller on the OpenShift cluster.

Validate that the NGINX Ingress Controller is running

[NOTE]
.Note
====
If the NGINX Ingress Controller Pod is not in a *running* state, verify
the *image:tag* value is correct from deployment manifest
====

Run this command in a terminal, to verify that the NGINX Ingress
Controller is running:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n nginx-ingress get pods
----

Example:

image:image24-3.png[image24-3]

Expose the NGINX Ingress Controller Dashboard

NGINX Ingress Controller (all purchased editions) has an internal
dashboard that can be exposed. The Dashboard provides analytic stats of
services deployed on NGINX. These stats can also be exposed to
collection systems like Prometheus.

Use wget to download the dashboard yaml.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f5devcentral/f5-digital-customer-engagement-center/main/solutions/delivery/application_delivery_controller/nginx/kic/templates/nginx-ingress-dashboard.yml
----

Next, we have to change the app selector in the yaml file. We can do
this with the _sed_ command.


[source,sh,role=execute]
----
sed -i 's/app\:\ nginx-ingress/app.kubernetes.io\/name\:\ nginx-ingress/' nginx-ingress-dashboard.yml
----


The yaml should now look like this:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat -n nginx-ingress-dashboard.yml
----

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
1  apiVersion: v1
2  kind: Service
3  metadata:
4    name: dashboard-nginx-ingress
5    namespace: nginx-ingress
6    annotations:
7      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: "tcp"
8  spec:
9    type: LoadBalancer
10    ports:
11    - port: 80
12      targetPort: 8080
13      protocol: TCP
14      name: http
15    selector:
16      app.kubernetes.io/name: nginx-ingress
----


Expose the Dashboard. In the terminal window copy the below text and
paste+enter:


[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f nginx-ingress-dashboard.yml
----

See the NGINX Ingress Controller services

[WARNING]
.Warning
====
The *EXTERNAL-IP* values will be used during several parts of the lab.
In AWS, this is an FQDN. It is recommended to copy these to an easily
referenceable location like a clipboard/digital notepad
====

The deployment of NGINX Controller Ingress contains two Kubernetes
services: Ingress and the other for Dashboard.

In the terminal window, copy the below text and paste+enter:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get svc -n nginx-ingress
----

Example:

Export the NGINX Ingress Controller services

Interacting with the NGINX Ingress Controller is more comfortable with
exporting the service External IPs into system variables. This allows
for templating to take place when we expose our applications.

In the terminal window copy the below text and paste+enter:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo 'export dashboard_nginx_ingress=$(oc get svc dashboard-nginx-ingress -n nginx-ingress --no-headers | tr -s " " | cut -d" " -f4)' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
----

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo 'export nginx_ingress=$(oc get svc my-nginx-ingress-controller -n nginx-ingress --no-headers | tr -s " " | cut -d" " -f4)' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

----

Browse to the exposed NGINX Ingress Controller services

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The Dashboard and the Ingress websites will take a few minutes to become
available (1-3 Minutes)
====

There is nothing yet deployed on NGINX Ingress Controller. However, the
Dashboard and the Ingress are active. When the services were created, OpenShift created an AWS ELB. These ELBs allow for access
to the services, and if the NGINX services ever scale, they will
dynamically be added.


This command will expose the URL for the dashboard.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo "http://$dashboard_nginx_ingress/dashboard.html"
----

Open the dashboard and save it for later use.  We will be referincing it several times in the lab.

Simmilarly, we can open the NGINX Ingress Controller URL, but since we don't have a web application installed yet, you will see a 404 message.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo "http://$nginx_ingress"
----

Example:

[arabic, start=12]

The NGINX Ingress Controller services have been created and exposed

At this point, we can deploy our applications, and provide access
through NGINX!
