image:image00.png[image00,scaledwidth=75.0%]

Welcome to Module 1 of our lab guide, where we will be exploring the
deployment of a modern application using the NGINX Ingress Controller
for Red Hat OpenShift. This solution is designed to provide a
comprehensive guide to successfully deploying an application with the
NGINX Ingress Controller, including step-by-step instructions and
helpful notes. Additionally, we will share relevant deployment styles
for modern applications through practical examples.

Our NGINX Ingress Controller solution can run on multiple clouds and the
documents below provide a clear order of operation for deploying an
application with NGINX Ingress Controller. It is important to note that
these steps assume you are using the Red Hat Demo System.

By the end of this module, you will be able to configure and deploy an
application using the NGINX Ingress Controller. The Module is expected
to take around *1 hour* to complete, and it consists of the following
main steps:

* Step 1: Setup
* Step 2: Configuration
* Step 3: Deployment
* Step 4: Testing

[NOTE]
====
The steps assume you are using the *Red Hat Demo Platform (RHDP)*
