== Arcadia Application Deployment

For this workshop, we are going to use the *Arcadia Financial*
application. The application is built with four different microservices
that are deployed in the Kubernetes environment.

* *Main* - provides access to the web GUI of the application for use by
browsers
* *Backend* - is a supporting microservice and provides support for the
customer-facing services only
* *App2* - provides money transfer API-based functionalities for both
the Web app and third-party consumer applications
* *App3* - provides referral API-based functionalities for both the Web
app and third-party consumer applications

All of our pods are created based on the
https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx-unit/[NGINX Unit] application
server.

NGINX Unit is a dynamic application server capable of running beside
NGINX Plus and NGINX Open Source or standalone. NGINX Unit supports a
RESTful JSON API, deploys configuration changes without service
disruptions, and runs apps built with multiple languages and frameworks.
Designed from scratch around distributed applications needs, it lays the
foundation for service mesh.

Deploy the Arcadia Application into Kubernetes

The Arcadia Application deployment is a single manifest file containing
the resources needed to build:
* Kubernetes deployment for the four Docker containers
* Kubernetes services for the four Docker containers

Get the YAML file. In the terminal window, copy the below text and
paste+enter:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f5devcentral/f5-digital-customer-engagement-center/main/solutions/delivery/application_delivery_controller/nginx/kic/templates/arcadia.yml
----

For this lab, we saved the container images to _quay.io_, a Red Hat
hosted container image registry. 

We need to modify the YAML file to usethe _quay.io_ registry:+

Paste the following into the terminal to modify the file. 

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
sed -i -e "s/tonymarfil\/arcadia-main:unit/quay.io\/redhat-gpst\/rhpds-nginxplus-arcadia-main/" arcadia.yml
sed -i -e "s/tonymarfil\/arcadia-backend:unit/quay.io\/redhat-gpst\/rhpds-nginxplus-arcadia-backend/" arcadia.yml
sed -i -e "s/tonymarfil\/arcadia-app2:unit/quay.io\/redhat-gpst\/rhpds-nginxplus-arcadia-app2/" arcadia.yml
sed -i -e "s/tonymarfil\/arcadia-app3:unit/quay.io\/redhat-gpst\/rhpds-nginxplus-arcadia-app3/" arcadia.yml
----

Apply the updated YAML file. 

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f ./arcadia.yml
----

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
$ oc apply -f ./arcadia.yml
deployment.apps/arcadia-main created
deployment.apps/arcadia-backend created
deployment.apps/arcadia-app2 created
deployment.apps/arcadia-app3 created
service/arcadia-main created
service/backend created
service/arcadia-app2 created
service/arcadia-app3 created
----

Next, let's verify the Arcadia application  objects were created.


[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get services | grep arcadia
----

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
$ oc get services | grep arcadia
