== Arcadia Application Deployment

For this workshop, we are going to use the *Arcadia Financial*
application. The application is built with four different microservices
that are deployed in the Kubernetes environment.

* *Main* - provides access to the web GUI of the application for use by
browsers
* *Backend* - is a supporting microservice and provides support for the
customer-facing services only
* *App2* - provides money transfer API based functionalities for both
the Web app and third party consumer applications
* *App3* - provides referral API based functionalities for both the Web
app and third party consumer applications

All of our pods are created based on the
https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx-unit/[NGINX Unit] application
server.

NGINX Unit is a dynamic application server capable of running beside
NGINX Plus and NGINX Open Source or standalone. NGINX Unit supports a
RESTful JSON API, deploys configuration changes without service
disruptions, and runs apps built with multiple languages and frameworks.
Designed from scratch around distributed applications needs, it lays the
foundation for service mesh.

. Deploy the Arcadia Application into Kubernetes
+
The Arcadia Application deployment is a single manifest file containing
the resources need to build.
* Kubernetes deployment for the four docker containers
* Kubernetes services for the four docker containers
+
Get the yaml file. In the terminal window, copy the below text and
paste+enter:
+
[source,]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f5devcentral/f5-digital-customer-engagement-center/main/solutions/delivery/application_delivery_controller/nginx/kic/templates/arcadia.yml
----

For this lab, we saved the container images to _quay.io_, a Red Hat
hosted container image registry. We would need to modify the yaml file
to use the _quay.io_ registry:
* quay.io/repository/redhat-gpst/rhpds-nginxplus-arcadia-main
* quay.io/repository/redhat-gpst/rhpds-nginxplus-arcadia-backend
* quay.io/repository/redhat-gpst/rhpds-nginxplus-arcadia-app2
* quay.io/repository/redhat-gpst/rhpds-nginxplus-arcadia-app3
