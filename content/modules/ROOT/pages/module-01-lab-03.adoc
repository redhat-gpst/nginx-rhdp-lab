= NGINX Ingress Controller Examples - Basic & HTTPS

Included below are several examples of NGINX Ingress Controller
deployments. It is recommended that you progress through building on top
of each other. Going this way highlights the lifecycle of
container-based services that will evolve.

The VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute resources are new
load-balancing configurations introduced in release 1.5 as an
alternative to the Ingress resource. The resources enable use cases not
supported with the Ingress resource, such as traffic splitting and
advanced content-based routing. The resources are implemented as
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[Custom
Resources].

A custom resource is an extension of the Kubernetes API that is not
necessarily available in a default Kubernetes installation. It
represents a customization of a particular Kubernetes installation.
However, many core Kubernetes functions are now built using custom
resources, making Kubernetes more modular.

Custom resources can appear and disappear in a running cluster through
dynamic registration, and cluster admins can update custom resources
independently of the cluster itself. Once a custom resource is
installed, users can create and access its objects using kubectl, just
as they do for built-in resources like Pods.

*NGINX Ingress Controller Examples*

* **Basic**: A simple Layer 7 routing ingress, directing traffic from the 
  EXTERNAL-IP address to the Arcadia application.
* **HTTPS**: Layer 7 routing ingress with TLS; the TLS secret is stored 
  in Kubernetes as a TLS Secret.

*Covered in the next exercise*

* **HTTPS with Active Monitors**: HTTPS routing with Active Health Monitors 
  to Pods.
* **HTTPS with Active Monitors, Caching**: Combines HTTPS, Active Health Monitors, 
  and caching for site content.
* **HTTPS with Active Monitors, Caching, mTLS**: Integrates HTTPS, Active Health 
  Monitors, caching, and mTLS for client certificate authentication.



## Basic

Create NGINX Ingress Controller with Basic HTTP:

In the terminal window, copy the below text and paste enter:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: k8s.nginx.org/v1
kind: VirtualServer
metadata:
  name: arcadia
spec:
  host: $nginx_ingress
  upstreams:
  - name: arcadia-main
    service: arcadia-main
    port: 80
  - name: arcadia-app2
    service: arcadia-app2
    port: 80
  - name: arcadia-app3
    service: arcadia-app3
    port: 80
  routes:
  - path: /
    action:
      pass: arcadia-main
  - path: /app2
    action:
      proxy:
        upstream: arcadia-app2
        rewritePath: /
  - path: /app3
    action:
      proxy:
        upstream: arcadia-app3
        rewritePath: /
EOF

The NGINX Dashboard should be updated reflecting the new services discovered

NGINX Dashboard URL (replace with the dashboard-nginx-ingress
EXTERNAL-IP): `http://EXTERNAL-IP/dashboard.html`

Example:

image:image32.png[image32]

Arcadia application is now exposed through the NGINX Ingress Controller
on HTTP!

NGINX Ingress Controller URL (replace with the nginx-ingress
EXTERNAL-IP): `http://EXTERNAL-IP/`

## HTTPS

[NOTE]
.Note
====
There is no change to the Dashboard when using HTTPS. However, the
Ingress will now listen on both port 80 and port 443
====

TLS Secrets stored in Kubernetes can be referenced with NGINX Ingress
Controller. First, we need to install them into Kubernetes.

=== Step 1. Create Kubernetes TLS Secret

In the terminal window, copy the below text and paste+enter:

=== Step 2. Create NGINX Ingress Controller with HTTPS:

In the terminal window, copy the below text and paste+enter:

Arcadia application is now exposed through the NGINX Ingress Controller
on HTTPS!

NGINX Ingress Controller URL (replace with the nginx-ingress
EXTERNAL-IP): `https://EXTERNAL-IP/` or `http://EXTERNAL-IP/`
