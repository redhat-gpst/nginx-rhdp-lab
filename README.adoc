Welcome to the NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller For OpenShift Lab Guide! This repository provides a hands-on experience with deploying and securing applications in an OpenShift environment using the NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller (KIC).

== Lab Purpose

The primary goal of this lab is to demonstrate how to deploy, configure, and manage the NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller in an OpenShift environment. It aims to showcase:

* **Application Delivery**: How to use the NGINX Ingress Controller to manage traffic, load balancing, and routing for applications within OpenShift.
* **Security**: How to leverage NGINX App Protect WAF to provide Layer 7 protection for applications running in Kubernetes.

The lab uses the Arcadia Financial application as an example app to demonstrate the features of NGINX KIC. However, the principles and techniques can be applied to other applications as well.

== Target Audience

This lab is designed for:

* OpenShift Administrators and Developers
* Kubernetes Operators
* DevOps and Security Engineers
* Anyone interested in learning how to deliver and secure applications using NGINX in OpenShift

== Prerequisites

Participants should have:

* Basic knowledge of Kubernetes, containers, and OpenShift
* An OpenShift cluster (local or remote) with access to OpenShift CLI (`oc`)
* Familiarity with NGINX, Ingress concepts, and Kubernetes security features

== What You Will Learn

By the end of this lab, participants will understand:

* How to deploy the NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller in OpenShift
* How to configure routing, load balancing, and advanced features using NGINX Custom Resources
* How to enable NGINX App Protect WAF to secure applications against Layer 7 attacks
* How to observe, test, and validate application security using real-world attack simulations

== Lab Structure

The lab is structured into three modules:

* **Module 1**: Deploying the NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller in OpenShift and setting up basic routing.
* **Module 2**: Enabling and configuring NGINX App Protect WAF for application security.
* **Module 3**: Testing and validating the NGINX App Protect WAF setup to ensure proper protection of applications.

== Disclaimer

This lab is intended for educational purposes only. It demonstrates security techniques and configurations within a controlled environment. Exercise caution when implementing similar configurations in production environments.
