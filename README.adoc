Welcome to the NGINX Ingress Controller For OpenShift Lab Guide! This lab guide is meant to by deployed in the Red Hat Demo Platform.  It is available here for informational purposes only.
This lab is intended for educational purposes only. It demonstrates security techniques and configurations within a controlled environment. Exercise caution when implementing similar configurations in production environments.

== Lab Purpose

The primary goal of this lab is to demonstrate how to deploy, configure, and manage the NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller in an OpenShift environment. It aims to showcase:

* **Application Delivery**: How to use the NGINX Ingress Controller to manage traffic, load balancing, and routing for applications within OpenShift.
* **Security**: How to leverage NGINX App Protect WAF to provide Layer 7 protection for applications running in Kubernetes.

The lab uses the Arcadia Financial application as an example app to demonstrate the features of NGINX KIC. However, the principles and techniques can be applied to other applications as well.

== Target Audience

This lab is designed for:

* OpenShift Administrators and Developers
* Kubernetes Operators
* DevOps and Security Engineers
* Anyone interested in learning how to deliver and secure applications using NGINX in OpenShift

== What You Will Learn

By the end of this lab, participants will understand:

* How to deploy the NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller in OpenShift
* How to configure routing, load balancing, and advanced features using NGINX Custom Resources
* How to enable NGINX App Protect WAF to secure applications against Layer 7 attacks
* How to observe, test, and validate application security using real-world attack simulations
